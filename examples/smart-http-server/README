This is a simple macruby rack app that serves git repos over the smart protocol.

It almost works.

The current blocking issue is that it appears that MacRuby 0.5 shuts down an open
socket if you try to send a null byte over it.  Perhaps this will be fixed in 0.6
or later, but right now it killed the idea.  I wanted to leave the code here in
case a later version supports it, I can quickly finish this up.
