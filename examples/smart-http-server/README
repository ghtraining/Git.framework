This is a simple macruby rack app that serves git repos over the smart protocol.
This helps me test the machinery a little bit easier - this way I can just run
this server and hit it with Git and see if I can clone projects and what not. It
might be interesting to use this as the basis for a Cocoa based Bananajour or 
something in the future.

There is an issue where it appears that MacRuby 0.5 shuts down an open
socket if you try to send a null byte over it.  Because of that, until it is
fixed in MacRuby, you have to unfortunately run a EventMachine based proxy
in front of it that will replace the string "~x0x~" with a null byte.  That
string artificially replaces null bytes by the Rack app because it knows that
MacRuby will explode if I try to send it over the wire.

Running This
================

(in two seperate terminals or something:)
$ macruby git_http.rb
$ ruby fing_fix.rb

$ git ls-remote http://localhost:8088/myproject.git

(it serves anything out of /opt by default, but you can change that in the 
git_http.rb script at the very bottom in the config hash)
